Everyone here was zer0 just after winning the final.
zer0. It was a sudden victory, but overall a challenging one. Game 1 You started pretty well. Game 2, Game 3... Bit bumpy then, game 4, 5, 6 you hit your stride, so what was happening in game 4, 5, 6 that was working out for you guys?

zer0
So Game 1, pretty much the hardest one possible, like, Bionomics, extreme bottom right of the map, Zonin's top core, extreme top left of the map, like, getting 12 points in that, like, I hate, like, insane reset, getting 12 points in that was insane, like, we were playing really well.

司会
Yeah.

zer0
Like, basically, we haven't lost a fight the entire tourney.


司会
Okay.

zer0
It's like, even though, like, losers happened, things like that, like, we did get targeted by LLG. Genuinely.

zer0
But then, uh, yeah, Game 2 we got inted very hard by Green Stego.

--ゲームシーン挿入--

司会
Yeah.

zer0
Game 4 as well, we, like, had a free win, and they just valko right behind us in God spot.

司会
Right, okay.

zer0
And then Game 5, like everything just started clicking, we all started playing insane.

司会
Yeah, Game 5 we had a lot of kills, we had like 11, I think, right?

zer0
Yeah.

--ゲームシーン挿入--

zer0
Like, I've wanted to Hal on Ballistic for like, a long time, but like, it never really works, because ballistic is usually unbanned when crypto is unbanned.

And if he plays like, uh, Fuse... That's what I mean, fuse is usually unbanned when ballistic is unbanned. That he needs to play fuse and then Wxltzy has to play crypto. So we kind of swapped.

But yeah, him on ballistic, it's like the best thing for his playstyle.

司会
Oh, nice.

zer0
Game one on ballistic. That's the first game on ballistic he's played in, like a while as well.

司会
Wow, okay.

zer0
And big win that game, it was like, very, very clean. Good rotates, zone was pretty interesting. Game five was... That was 1v1.

司会
That's the one with 11 kills, and then game six is when you...

zer0
Yeah, game six is like, that was the first time I played that comp. Like, Callum Wraith, Mion Bang, it's like our signature characters. Pretty funny. And before the game, I called it a 1v1, and as soon as I saw zone pop, I was like, Oh my god.

司会
We've just won.

zer0
It's just over.


------ Rotation Reasoning ---------

司会
I had a question, though, you went from the building to the bridge, why did you swap?


Speaker 0 | 02:50.349
So um that backtrack spot is usually a good spot for pitting against all those zones, but I pulled a bit towards building again. The zone after we left, just after we left.
But playing at first zone, especially with our comp and loot, you're always getting inted by someone.
And it was a green stego go again,
just inted. Small factor, we third party for free, and then there's three squads left.
And then, funnily enough, Strafing, who was the team in Ravine the entire game, thought the other team was us and just spent two minutes just hard inting them.

司会
Right. Were you waiting to third party?

zer0
Yeah.

司会
Was that the plan? Or were you just trying to get to the other building? We're just waiting for the third party?

zer0
Yeah.


--------------------------------------


司会
Okay. This is obviously your first win with HAL.
A lot was made of your interaction with each other. What's your perspective on it? I think obviously there was a featured stage where people could hear you maybe more often than they normally would. Why does it work for you, that communication style? What do you have to say about it?


zer0
I'm not going to try and argue that it's healthy or anything.

If, like, two people who respect each other enough, Yeah. Nothing we say, like, really sticks. And like, we both live in Austin, like, go out Ireland a lot. That's not like, we're gonna start hating each other randomly, especially outside. 


司会
Yeah. I mean, sportsmen are like that, aren't they? Sportsmen, on the pitch, it's like you might be fierce, but then their mates are after it. It's kind of like that relationship.

zer0
yeah.

司会
Okay. So how about Waltsey?
Obviously, what did you direct him? What advice did you give him?
You know, you've won and it's his first event.
What were you telling him? What were you whispering in his ear?


zer0
It was kind of weird. Like, my first LAN win, I was absolutely freaked out. It was like a big break. But for him, he's like on our team. And the LAN was like, just very interesting finals. I don't know how to explain what just happened. Like, 15 squads, Zone 1, and a land finder is completely unheard of.


--------------------------------------
司会
Okay, yeah. So how impactful was the Legend Bans and do you think you should continue doing Legend bans?


zer0
I'm not sure if legend bans are the problem with why games have been so much worse quality.
But Newcastle Metal was quite depressing as well. But legend bans are definitely really good for the good teams. There's not many flexible players in the game at all.

Especially a lot of control players struggle playing different characters.
But Wxlter's like... Probably the most flexible control player, like he went from hard IGLing on bang only entry fragging. He's playing crypto. It's like not many people can really handle that.

司会
So how many, uh, legends are you trying to each learn? You're trying to learn what's like a decent number for you to be like, healthy and competition. 

zer0
Basically one person only plays captchas, and then she gets banned, you maybe play a third, It's like fairly simple, like ballistic, is like not really a character.
So like you can check anyone. They just run at someone, it's all good, and then, yeah, someone else plays Newcastle Crypto. Yeah, basically the entire time. And then, like a Watson, something like that.
And then me, like, just try to take all the hardest characters. 

司会
Okay, what are the hardest characters?

zer0
Just like entry space making characters, and like rotational characters.
Like, well, that series I played Alter, Ash, Wraith, Bang, and sometimes, like, get to like five or six in a series.


--------------------------------------
司会
Okay,yeah, they were starting to get like, into interesting band, but you just won, like, suddenly, you said. It's an interesting finals, obviously a lot more teams in, like the end circles. What do you think of the format of having, like, you know, a lot of free agent teams in the finals? How is it different for you?

zer0
I think the format is a horrendous idea.
Like, the other thing is cool, because you want teams that don't have the opportunity to show out, like, have their break.
But Apex is the least gate-kept esport in the world.
Like, it's an open call to Pro league, and you play against the best teams.
So if you can't make it out of CC, I don't know. 
But Togaholic's like, really, the only one. Togaholic. And then finals, they kind of just do nothing as well.


司会
Okay, so if you could tweak the format but still have this kind of open, what would you do?


zer0
I think just groups are a good idea because, like for us especially, we have 100 points, group one, bad lobby, and then group two. We get target entered by the team that wins first game, but we get taken out and we're in losers. And we can't get top 10 seed for the rest of the tourney. And then we won like three out of the next, like five lobbies.

司会
Wow, okay.

zer0
And like, we have more points than ever in the land, but we can't get top 10.
It doesn't really seem that great.


司会
Yeah, people are making a lot of you like almost being eliminated.
Was it actually that scary for you? You're kind of like, fine.

zer0
um, only the second last group, second last group is actually pretty worrying.


司会
Right, okay. And how does this win rank with your other ones? Because I've been present for many of them and you've grown up. How does it rank?

zer0
I'm not sure if our point average is higher than Split 2 London. But I think Split 2 London was like... Sweden was the best, and then Split 2, London, and then probably Champs, and then this one.

司会
So it's all about points, it's not about something else, not like emotion or like... Is it all about how many points you got, how many kills you got?

zer0
Sweden will always be the most important to me, for sure. I think it's the best one I've played. I think point average is the best stat, especially with no starting points and taking into consideration our draft. And Seoul deciding to land epicenter instead of geyser randomly, then just coming 17th, that was pretty cool.

司会
Did you want to shout? Any other teams apart from Twerkaholics you think did pretty well this event?

zer0
Well, I think Hended Thieves showed promise, they had a 110 point group, playing hard zone, but I think their drafts really hindered them. Really random draft, there's really no explanation for it. Third picking E-Bank, it's like a not even a top five POI, top seven poi on the map, they pick it third overall. But I mean, alliance here, like, it seems like it's gonna be another year of Arsenal Alliance.

司会
Okay, fair enough, and what does this win mean for you? That's my last question, I mean, did you know it was going to come? Were you worried that it wouldn't come? Did it take longer than you expected to win an event?

zer0
Definitely took longer than expected, like considering last year we had one event 20th, the other three, very winnable. Very, very winnable, probably should have won two at least. And then yeah, just watching other people take my trophy every LAN. over and over again.


司会
Your trophy, yeah. What was it you said on stage? You didn't say it was easy, you said it needed a challenge. What was it you said on stage?

zer0
It was pretty free.

司会
Free, okay. And do you genuinely feel that? Or is it just a meme?

zer0
Yeah, I think there's like four teams in the game. But, like, Strafing's team's doing pretty well.
I feel like how good zones were for them, but I think a few of them were quite fortunate.
 But yeah, like us, 100 Thieves, Shopify, Alliance. Alliance just seems like a bit of a different level than the other two.

司会
Right, fair enough, so they're your main challenge. You think, yeah, okay, cool, thank you very much.
